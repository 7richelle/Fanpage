	 <center> <h2><ol><b>Aang</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/13043138/Avatar-Netflix-Featured.jpg"width="355" height="250"></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p>He is an incarnation of the "Avatar", the spirit of light and peace manifested in human form. As the Avatar,
	  Aang controls all four elements (water, earth, fire, and air) and is tasked with bringing balance and keeping the 
	  Four Nations at peace. At biologically 112 years old (physically 12), Aang is the series' reluctant hero, spending
	  a century in suspended animation in an iceberg before being discovered and joining new friends Katara and Sokka on 
	  a quest to master the elements and save their world from the imperialist Fire Nation.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <center> <h2><ol><b>Zuko</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/Prince_Zuko.jpg" width="350" height="250"></center>
	  <div class="myChar">
	  <p>Zuko is the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and a skilled firebender, meaning he has the ability to create and control
	  fire. He is the eldest child of Fire Lord Ozai and the older brother of Princess Azula. Before the events of the series, 
	  Zuko is banished from the Fire Nation by his father and told he must capture the Avatar, a unique spiritually powerful individual
	  who could end the 100 year war - the fire nation's conquest for world domination, in order to restore his honour and right to the 
	  throne. Zuko is accompanied and advised in his search by his uncle Iroh.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <center> <h2><ol><b>Katara</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Agca3bOgL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" width="250" height="290"></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p>Katara is a 14-year-old "waterbender", meaning that she has the ability to control water, ice and blood (also known as bloodbending).
	  At the beginning of the story, she is the only person with such abilities in the Southern Water Tribe, one of two known communities in 
	  which waterbending is practiced. She and her older brother, Sokka, discover an "airbender" (one who can manipulate air) named Aang frozen
	  in an iceberg. They free him and accompany him on his quest to defeat the imperialistic Fire Nation and bring peace to the war-torn world.
	  She later earns the title of Master Waterbender from Master Pakku of the Northern Water Tribe.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <center> <h2><ol><b>Toph Beifong</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/8/87/Toph_Beifong_attacks_The_Boulder.png/revision/latest?cb=20200326152205&path-prefix=vi" width="250" height="250"></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p>Toph is recognized as a prodigy of earthbending, which is the ability to telekinetically manipulate, reshape and
	  control stone, sand, dirt, and, later, metal. Because she was born blind, and her parents believed that her condition limited
	  her capacity to learn and use the skill safely, they had a tutor teach her only basic earthbending. She later learned more 
	  advanced earthbending secretly from the badgermoles.She eventually becomes 
	  the first person to develop the ability to "bend" metal as well.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Sokka</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/47/4b/12/474b12d8f41063ff28bbc769e2f35bdb.jpg" width="250" height="250"></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p>Sokka is a warrior of the Southern Water Tribe, a nation where some people are able to telekinetically manipulate, or "bend", water.
	  Unlike his companions, Sokka is a non-bender, but as the show progresses he masters swordplay and proves himself to be a worthy and intelligent strategist. Being a non-bender, Sokka uses different 
	  weapons such as his boomerang and machete; and eventually a jian sword to combat enemies.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Iroh</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/c/c1/Iroh_smiling.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/360?cb=20130626131914" width="300" height="250"></center>
	    <div class="myChar">
	  <p>Iroh is a very powerful firebender—i.e., he has the power to telekinetically create and manipulate fire—and a retired general 
	  of the Fire Nation. He is the elder brother of Fire Lord Ozai, the ruler of the Fire Nation and leader of its campaign to conquer 
	  the other three nations.During the narrative of the series, he accompanies his exiled nephew Zuko on his quest to capture the 
	  series's protagonist Aang to restore the young prince's honor and birthright; Iroh acts as a mentor who seeks to help his nephew become 
	  a better person than his father.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Ozai</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/the-surprising-actor-who-voices-firelord-ozai-in-avatar/intro-1633473525.jpg"width="380" height="255" ></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p> Ozai was the ruler of the Fire Nation, General Iroh's younger brother, Zuko and Azula's father, and the 
	  main antagonist of the series. Ozai shows Azula favor, but only 
	  due to her skill as a prodigy and being an embodiment of his ideals rather than any genuine love. Having welcomed his son home after Azula 
	  lied to him that Zuko killed Aang, Ozai is furious to learn of the Avatar's survival.When Sozin's Comet draws near, Ozai renames 
	  himself 'Phoenix King' and embarks to destroy the Earth Kingdom, entrusting an unstable Azula with their homeland. Defeated by Aang, Ozai
	  is stripped of his ability to firebend and imprisoned.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Azula</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Azula.png" ></center>
	    <div class="myChar">
	  <p> Azula is the crown princess of the Fire Nation and an extremely powerful firebending prodigy. Upon Fire Lord Ozai's orders, 
	  she begins a quest with her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee to retrieve her banished brother Prince Zuko and his mentor, their uncle 
	  Iroh, while also attempting to capture Avatar Aang, considered the Fire Nation's greatest threat to victory in the war. Azula is known 
	  for being a skilled strategist and manipulator.As her brother Zuko states, she "always lies."Throughout the original series and 
	  the sequel comics, she is shown to be capable of highly advanced firebending, producing hotter blue flames as well as lightning.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Ty Lee</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/62/44/72/6244721d01b122f307004b70ec4cdfc6.jpg" width="250" height="250"></center>
	   <div class="myChar">
	  <p> Ty Lee is cheerful, energetic, and somewhat of a valley girl who, along with Mai, accompanies her 
	  childhood friend Azula on her quest.She is a peerless acrobat and can paralyze people or temporarily neutralize their bending powers by striking
	  pressure points in a similar fashion to the martial art style of Dim Mak. In Book Three, she was temporarily imprisoned after she 
	  supported Mai and Zuko against Azula, and released when the Fire Lord was defeated. She later joined the Kyoshi Warriors (
	  contradictory to her earlier statement of not wanting to be part of a matching set), whom she had earlier impersonated in Book Two.
	 </p>
	  </div>
	  
	   <center> <h2><ol><b>Mai</b></ol></h2>
	  <img src="https://www.voquent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mai500.jpg" width="250" height="270"></center>
	    <div class="myChar">
	  <p> Mai is an impassive, bored, stoic young noblewoman who, along with Ty Lee, is a friend and accomplice of Azula. Her primary weapons are throwing knives, darts, and shuriken 
	  concealed in her clothing, all of which she can throw with lethal accuracy. Mai eventually becomes Zuko's girlfriend, although he leaves 
	  her to join Aang and Team Avatar. She later visits him when he is incarcerated in Boiling Rock prison; upon his escape, Mai shocks everyone by 
	  holding off the guards and dueling Azula herself, explaining that her love for Zuko is stronger than her fear of Azula. She is released after 
	  Azula's defeat,and reunites with Zuko. </p>
